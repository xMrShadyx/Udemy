// Method overloading is a feature that allows us to have more than one method with
// the same name, so long as we use different parameters.

// It is the ability to create multiple methods of the same name with different
// implementations.

// Calls to an overloaded method will run a specific implementation of that method.

// In the example from the previous video we had calculateScore method with 0, 1 and 2 parameters.

// As an example, let's say you have to create a method which can do
// The sum of two number
// The sum of three numbers
// And the sum of four numbers.
// Each method would have parameters passed to it with the numbers to sum.
