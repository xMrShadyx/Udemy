    // The (&& AND) operator comes in two flavors in Java, as does the (OR ||) operator.
    // && is the logical AND which operates on boolean operands - Checking if a given condition is true or false.
    // You will almost always want to be doing this. The "&" is a bitwise operator working at the bit level. This is an
    // advanced concept that we won't get into here.
    // Likewise, (|| OR) is the Logical OR what again operates on boolean operands - Checking if a given condition is true or false.
    // Again, you will almost always want to be doing this. The "|" is a bitwise, operator working at the bit level.
