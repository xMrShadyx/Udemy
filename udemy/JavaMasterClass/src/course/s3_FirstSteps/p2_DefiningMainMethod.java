        // Statement - This is a complete command to be executed and can include one or more
        // expressions (we'll see these in action later).

        // Code block - A code block is used to define a block of code. It's mandatory to have one in a
        // method declaration, and it's here where we will be adding statements to perform certain tasks.

}

// What is a method? It's a collection of statements (one or more) that performs an
// operation. We'll be using a special method called the main method that java looks for
// when running a program. It's the entry point of any java code.

// You can create your own methods as you will see later, but for now, let's create this main method.

// public: is an access modifier we discussed when defining the class in the last video - same principle.

// static: is a java keyword that needs an understanding of other concepts, for now, know that we
// need to have static for java to find our method to run the code we are going to add.

// Void: is yet another java keyword used to indicate that the method will not return anything -
// more on that later.

// The left and right parenthesis in a method declaration are mandatory and can optionally
// include one or more parameters - which is a way to pass information to a method. More on
// that later.
