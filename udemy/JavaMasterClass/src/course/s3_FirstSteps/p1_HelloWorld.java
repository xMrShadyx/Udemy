// Java program (and most other programming languages) have keyword. Each has a
// specific meaning, and sometimes they need to be used in specific orders.

// You write Java programs by following a specific set of rules, using a combination of these
// keywords and other things you will see which collective form a java program.

// NOTE: keywords are case-sensitive - public and Public and even PUBLIC are different things.

// public and class are two java keywords - they have a specific meaning which we will find out more
// about moving forward.

//The public java keyword is an access modifier. An access modifier allows us to define the
// score or how other parts of your code or even some else's code can access this code.
// More on that later.

// For now, we will use the public access modifier to give full access. We'll come back to
// access modifiers once we get further into the course.

// Defining a class. The class keyword is used to define a class with the name following the keyword - p1_HelloWorld
// in this case and left and right curly braces to define the class block.

// To define a class requires an optional access modifier, followed by class, followed by the left
// and right curly braces.

// The left and right curly braces are defining the class body - anything in between them is
// "part" of this class. We can have data and code as you will see as we progress.
